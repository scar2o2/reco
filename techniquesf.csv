technique,Description,How it works,Pros,Cons
Terrace Farming,Involves creating stepped levels on a sloped landscape to create flat areas for growing crops.,Terraces are built with retaining walls on slopes to hold the soil and reduce water runoff. Irrigation is often integrated.,"Prevents soil erosion and water runoff, Maximizes arable land in hilly terrains, Helps conserve water through efficient irrigation.","Expensive and labor-intensive to build and maintain, Can lead to long-term land degradation if not properly managed."
Slash-and-Burn Agriculture,A method of clearing land by cutting down and burning vegetation to create space for crops.,"Trees and plants are cut and burned to create ash, enriching the soil. Crops like maize, cassava, or rice are planted.","Quick and simple land preparation, Ash temporarily enriches the soil.","Leads to deforestation and loss of biodiversity, Can cause long-term soil degradation and erosion, Emission of greenhouse gases."
Shifting Cultivation,"A method where different crops are cultivated in various plots of land, rotating over time.","Farmers clear a patch of land, grow crops for a few years, then leave it fallow to regenerate before moving to a new plot.","Maintains soil fertility if managed properly, Reduces the need for chemical fertilizers.","Requires large amounts of land, Can lead to deforestation and soil erosion if not carefully managed."
Hydroponics,Growing plants without soil by using mineral nutrient solutions in water.,Plants are grown in water-based nutrient solutions in controlled environments like greenhouses. Plants are supported by a growing medium like gravel or clay balls.,"Uses less water than traditional farming, Can be used in areas with poor or contaminated soil, Enables year-round production in controlled conditions.","High initial setup costs, Requires constant monitoring of nutrient and water levels."
Agroforestry,Integrating trees and shrubs into crop and livestock farming systems.,"Farmers plant trees alongside crops and animals, creating a diverse farming system. Trees improve soil fertility and protect crops from wind or erosion.","Enhances biodiversity, Improves soil health and water retention, Reduces the impact of extreme weather events.","May require more land and management knowledge, Can be complex to integrate various species effectively."
Crop Rotation,Rotating different crops in the same field over multiple seasons to maintain soil health.,Crops are rotated each season to prevent soil depletion and break pest and disease cycles.,"Increases soil fertility, Reduces pest and disease buildup.","Requires careful planning of crop sequences, Can reduce yields in the short term if not done correctly."
Dryland Farming,Farming in arid regions where irrigation is not available and rainfall is limited.,Crops are selected based on drought tolerance. Farmers use water conservation techniques like mulching and deep plowing.,"Suitable for regions with limited water resources, Helps conserve water in arid climates.","Unpredictable yields due to erratic rainfall, Requires careful selection of crops and management."
Aquaculture,"Farming of aquatic organisms like fish, shellfish, or algae.","Fish or shellfish are raised in tanks, ponds, or ocean-based pens. Their environment is carefully monitored for water quality and feeding.","Provides an efficient and sustainable source of protein, Can be integrated with other farming methods (e.g., agroforestry).","Can lead to water pollution and spread of diseases if not managed properly, Overfishing of wild stocks can be an issue."
No-Till Farming,A method that avoids tilling the soil to preserve its structure and reduce erosion.,Crops are planted directly into untilled soil using specialized machinery. The soil retains moisture and organic matter.,"Reduces soil erosion, Improves water retention, Saves time and energy costs related to tilling.","Can lead to weed problems, requiring herbicide use, May not be suitable for all types of crops or soil conditions."
Polyculture,Growing multiple crops together in the same space.,"Multiple crops are planted together, often with complementary benefits like shade and pest control.","Increases biodiversity, Reduces risk of crop failure, Enhances soil health, Minimizes pest outbreaks.","Requires careful planning and management, Harvesting and processing can be more complex."
